Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   src/main/kotlin/NothingInItAGAIN_DELETE

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   src/main/kotlin/NothingInItAGAIN_DELETE

 lets use  the following to stage :

 git add  NothingInItAGAIN_DELETE

 git commit -m "commited NothingInItAGAIN_DELETE "

 lets push the file to git  hub using git push
